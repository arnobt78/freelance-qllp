## Project Summary

This repository is a complete, real-world example of how to build a highly modular, reusable, and visually flawless UI system for e-commerce or category-driven web apps. It features:

- **Centralized, dynamic product data** for all UI components
- **Interactive, multi-select category filter bar** with custom SVG icons
- **Reusable product cards** and detail pages, fully dynamic and data-driven
- **Pagination** and responsive grid layouts
- **Mobile-first, accessible design**

All components are designed for maximum reusability, maintainability, and ease of integration into other projects. The codebase is ideal for learning, rapid prototyping, or as a foundation for production e-commerce UIs.

---

## Features

- **Pixel-perfect Figma/SVG Matching:** All UI elements (dropdowns, checkboxes, icons, layouts) match the Figma reference exactly.
- **Reusable Components:** Includes `FilterDropDown`, `CategoryFilterMenuBar`, `ProductCard`, `Pagination`, and more.
- **Dynamic Multi-select Filtering:** Category filter bar supports independent, multi-select dropdowns for brands, flavors, and strengths, updating the product grid in real time.
- **Centralized Product Data:** All product info is managed in a single TypeScript file for easy updates and scalability.
- **Custom SVG Icons:** All icons are implemented as SVG for crisp, scalable rendering.
- **Responsive & Accessible:** Fully mobile-friendly, keyboard navigable, and accessible with ARIA/focus states.
- **Bug-free UX:** All known issues (duplicate checkboxes, filter logic, etc.) are fixed.
- **Modern Stack:** Built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint.
- **Easy Theming:** All styles are managed with Tailwind for rapid customization.
- **Clear Project Structure:** Logical, scalable file organization for easy extension.

## Component Walkthrough

### 1. CategoryFilterMenuBar (`src/components/CategoryFilter/CategoryFilterMenuBar.tsx`)

- Renders the main filter bar UI with multiple `FilterDropDown` components (Brand, Flavor, Strength)
- Dynamically generates dropdown options from product data
- Handles layout, divider lines, and filter state

### 2. FilterDropDown (`src/components/CategoryFilter/FilterDropDown.tsx`)

- Reusable dropdown with custom checkboxes and SVG icons
- Supports multi-select, keyboard navigation, and accessibility
- Designed for pixel-perfect Figma accuracy

### 3. ProductCard Components (in `/src/components/ProductCard/`)

- `ListProductCard.tsx`: Renders the product grid, filter bar, and pagination
- `SingleProductCard.tsx`: Displays individual product info (image, title, price, etc.)
- `ProductDetailLayout.tsx`: Product detail page, fully dynamic and responsive
- All product data is imported from a single source for consistency

### 4. Pagination (`src/components/Pagination/Pagination.tsx`)

- Handles pagination controls for product listings and filter results
- Responsive, accessible, and visually consistent

### 5. Layout & Global Styles (`src/app/layout.tsx` and `src/app/globals.css`)

- Sets up the overall page structure and applies Tailwind-based global styles

---

## Usage & Examples

### Main Page Example (`src/app/page.tsx`)

```tsx
import { ListProductCard } from "../components/ProductCard/ListProductCard";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-screen bg-white px-2">
      <ListProductCard />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Reusing Components in Other Projects

1. **Copy the desired component(s) and their dependencies** from `/src/components/` into your own project.

```tsx
   import { CategoryFilterMenuBar } from "./components/CategoryFilter/CategoryFilterMenuBar";
   import { ListProductCard } from "./components/ProductCard/ListProductCard";
   // ...
```

2. **Import and use as needed:**

```tsx
   import { CategoryFilterMenuBar } from "./components/CategoryFilter/CategoryFilterMenuBar";
   import { ListProductCard } from "./components/ProductCard/ListProductCard";
   // ...
```

3. **Provide your own product data** (see `src/data/products.ts` for the data structure).

4. **Customize styles** via Tailwind classes or by editing SVG assets in `/public`.

---

## Customization & Learning

- **Component Reuse:** Add more filters by extending the `CategoryFilterMenuBar` and updating the product data structure.
- **Styling:** All styles are driven by Tailwind CSS for rapid, utility-first customization. Change colors, spacing, or icon assets by editing the relevant classes or SVG files in `/public`.
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation and focus states are built-in. For further accessibility, review and extend ARIA attributes as needed.
- **Design Updates:** To match new Figma files, replace the SVGs in `/public` or adjust Tailwind classes in component files.
- **Teaching Tool:** The codebase is ideal for learning best practices in modular React, TypeScript, and Next.js development.

---

## API & Routing

- This project is frontend-only and uses static product data for demonstration.
- Next.js App Router is used for all routing and rendering.
- Product detail pages are rendered dynamically based on the product index in the URL (e.g., `/product-detail?idx=2`).
- To integrate with a backend API, extend the data fetching logic in the relevant component or page files.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **ESLint**
- **SVG Assets** (for icons)
